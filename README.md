This repository contains a android app I have worked on using MLKit to detect faces in a photo taken by the user.

This is a screenshot of the app upon opening, by clicking the floating action button you will be able to take a pciture and send it to the face detector

this screenshot shows the app after I took a picture of myself, the app outlines the face it finds in yellow and tells the user how many faces were found in the image
